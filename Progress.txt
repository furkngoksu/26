First of all, we have completed most of the data preprocessing and cleaning parts.

You will find many data cleaning steps in the Cleaning section.
The ScalingReal section includes data preprocessing, celaning and scaling stages.

We will continue to improve and edit these parts. We have a few algorithms and methods that we will add. Once we have organized these and made them useful, we will load the Testing part and test the model. After making the final arrangements, our Model will be ready.


There are model development algorithms in the Development section.
In the visualization section, there are a few visualization techniques to get information about the data.
Note : Cleaning section and ScalingReal section done earlier but uploaded now with the development part.
