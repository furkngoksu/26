# Music Recommendation System

This repository contains a comprehensive music recommendation system developed to offer personalized song recommendations based on an in-depth analysis of the Spotify music dataset.

## Overview

The music recommendation system is designed to provide users with tailored song suggestions by analyzing various music features and employing advanced clustering algorithms.                                                         |

### Motivation

The goal behind this project is to create a robust music recommendation system that understands user preferences and suggests songs accordingly. By leveraging Spotify's extensive dataset, the system aims to enhance user experience and engagement on the music streaming platform.

### Project Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Retrieval of the Spotify music dataset containing various features and attributes of songs.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Robust cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
3. **Feature Analysis:** In-depth exploration and analysis of song features like danceability, energy, loudness, and more.
4. **Clustering Techniques:** Utilization of diverse clustering algorithms to categorize songs based on features.
5. **Distance Metrics Analysis:** Examination of song similarities using various distance metrics for accurate clustering.
6. **Content-Based Filtering:** Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and music characteristics.
7. **Visualization and Interpretation:** Advanced visualization techniques aid in interpreting complex music features for deeper insights.
8. **User Interface Development:** Creation of an interactive interface allowing users to explore and access recommendations.
9. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation using metrics like Silhouette Score and user feedback to refine the system.
